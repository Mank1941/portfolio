                    <strong>Logline:</strong> A story about almosts, dreams, and the ache of quiet love. One location. One fantasy. One heartbreak.<br><br>
                    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> In the quiet corners of a university library, a boy finally speaks to the girl he has long admired from afar. Their conversation is delicate, beautiful, and everything he ever dreamed of — because it is a dream. He wakes up, and she's still across the room. Within reach, but never his.<br><br>

                <h2>The Perfect Party — Short Film</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently in Pre-Production<br><br>
                    Writter, Producer and Director<br><br>
                    <strong>Logline:</strong><br>John hosts the perfect Christmas party but no one shows up.<br><br>
                    <strong>Synopsis:</strong><br> John, an earnest and hopeful host, who sets out to throw the perfect Christmas party. Determined to create a night filled with warmth, games, and togetherness, he meticulously plans every detail-from themed cookies to a gingerbread house competition. 
                    His sister Hannah cautions him not to expect too much from people but John’s optimism refuses to dim.<br>
                    When the evening arrives, John’s excitement quickly meets disappointment. Guests trickle in half-heartedly, unprepared and uninterested-they didn’t even read the invite that explained his unique idea for everyone to bring their own ornament to decorate the Christmas tree.<br> 
                    What was meant to be a cozy, heartfelt celebration becomes awkward and hollow as guests treat it like a pit stop before heading to another-livelier party.<br>
                    Left alone after everyone leaves early, John quietly cleans up the remains of his failed gathering. In the stillness, he toasts to an empty room, reflecting on the meaning of togetherness and the loneliness beneath his pursuit of perfection.<br>
                    Just when the night seems over, a knock at the door breaks the silence. It’s Shanta–arriving late but carrying milk, cookies and a single ornament. She hangs it on the bare tree, bringing a flicker of genuine Christmas spirit to John’s lonely night.<br>
                    As they sit to watch the movie he had planned for everyone, John smiles for the first time—not because everything went perfectly, but because, finally, it feels real.<br><br>
